# Application-of-robust-normal-estimation-method-in-geotechnical-3D-point-cloud
The code snippets attempt to extract planes from 3D point clouds. The codes were written in Python 3.6.1 and might not be compatible with older versions of the programming language.
The original code files for performing Deterministic MM-estimator were based on and translated (from MATLAB to Python) from https://wis.kuleuven.be/stat/robust/software and the link mentioning DetMM and DetS.


To Run the codes, you should open the main-new.py and run it. All the components are called sequentially to do the job. Also, a 3D point cloud is uploaded for the ease of performance.
The code in the file is commented to help you understand how it is running. Depending on your computer speed, the code might take a considerable time. Due to this fact, please be patient and follow the given instructions.
